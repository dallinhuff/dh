  <p>
    Most of my professional experience with the web has been building
    <em>applications</em> rather than <em>documents</em>. When building this
    site, I wanted to depart completely from that paradigm and return to the
    World Wide Web I knew when I was a kid: just plain old static HTML and CSS.
  </p>

  <p>
    This site uses <code>Astro.js</code> as a build tool to make things easier for
    me, but the end result is a simple collection of cache-friendly, fast-loading
    pages with no JavaScript, no "utility class" clutter in the markup, and no minified/uglified
    obfuscation of my source files.
