    I currently work as a software engineer for Fidelity Brokerage's Digital
    Security cohort, which is primarily responsible for the many
    authentication flows Fidelity supports for retail, workplace, and
    institutional customers.

    The apps and services I work most closely with are responsible for
    managing signing and encryption keys used throughout much of our
    enterprise infrastructure. That's about all I can say on the matter.

    Opiniion is a platform for property management companies to collect
    feedback from residents to gain insights into their residents'
    satisfaction.

    While at Opiniion, I built and maintained integrations we had with 14+
    third-party services like Yardi and Entrata to synchronize resident data
    between these systems. I also built an internal tool for auditing our
    customers' integrations to ensure the data we were ingesting was correct
    and up to date.

    One of my greatest accomplishments at Opiniion was using a best-fit
    bin-packing algorithm to parallelize some of our batch jobs across
    multiple processes. My changes increased processing throughput by more
    than 400%, cutting jobs that took over a day to complete down to a few
    hours.

    I also oversaw a large-scale refactor of several services to cut SLOC by
    more than 80% for some of our integrations.

    I interned at Fidelity in the summer of 2024 as a software engineer for
    the Cloud and Platform Enablement team.

    My team's main product was a platform for GitOps-managed Kubernetes
    deployments. Customers could deploy their containerized apps on EKS with
    autoscaling, blue/green deployments, etc. without needing to manage
    their own k8s manifests or Helm charts.

    While working for CAPE, I built and deployed an application using Go and
    Vue.js for triaging and voting on feature requests.

    Learning Suite is a proprietary learning management system (LMS) built
    by faculty and students at Brigham Young University.

    While at Learning Suite, I primarily worked on migrating portions of the
    instructor application from jQuery/Handlebars.js to Vue.js. I built a
    scoring page where course instructors could view and edit students'
    scores, grades, and statistics as tabular data (think bespoke Google
    Sheets for professors). Working on the scoring page taught me a lot
    about complex state management patterns and performance benchmarking in
    the browser.

    My time at Learning Suite holds a special place in my heart because it's
    also where I met my wonderful wife, Megan.
